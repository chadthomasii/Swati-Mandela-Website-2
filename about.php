            <p>
                <b>Princess Zamaswazi (Swati) Mandela</b>, has a story to
                tell. It is not merely the chronicle of a young girl
                growing up in the shadow of arguably the most
                influential couple of the 20th century, her
                grandparents Nelson and Winnie Mandela, although
                that is certainly a part of it. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Rather, Swati’s is the story of a high-achieving young
                South African woman who turned her celebrity into a
                global platform to empower women, and to fight for
                social justice, diversity and equality for those living
                with disabilities, and educational opportunities for
                disadvantaged youth. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                That fight has taken many forms, from teaching her considerable entrepreneurial and public
                relations skills, to fundraising and consultancy. Recently it has pivoted to making her one of the
                most in demand speakers in the world. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Swati grew up in a world of contrasts. Even as her grandfather, Nelson Mandela, was becoming an
                iconic, revered figure throughout the world, in her native land, the media and post-Apartheid
                patriarchal system were vilifying her grandmother. Aware of the horrors her grandfather had
                endured, while at the same time observing the scorn heaped upon her grandmother, Winnie
                Mandela, she began to understand the role the media played in shaping opinion and both
                correcting and enabling injustice. She went on to earn her bachelor’s degree in Applied Public
                Relations from Midrand Graduate Institute in 2002. She worked for several communications firms,
                including Blackrock and Tincan, and in the press office of prestigious fashion designer House of
                Busby, before taking a position as spokesperson and chief fundraiser for 21 Icons. Among her
                successful projects for the firm were lead roles in producing documentaries on South Africa’s three
                Nobel Peace Prize winners: Desmond Tutu, F.W. de Klerk and, of course, Nelson Mandela.

                She is co-editor of “491 Days,” a book written by her grandmother that details the brutality she
                received living under an Apartheid state. She also wrote the foreword to the book, “The Prison Letters of Nelson Mandela” (Published 2018), a collection of Nelson Mandela’s prison letters
                spanning the 27 years he was held as a political prisoner. Swati is proud to serve as a Global
                Ambassador/Mentor for AIME, an organization dedicated to building a “World Of Mentoring”, a
                bridge between universities and high schools.

                Swati is also a fashion designer and entrepreneur. In 2017, Swati launched her luxury clothing
                label Swati by Roi Kaskara.

            <p>
                During her career climb, Swati had been pondering ways to improve the human condition. Her
                ideas began to coalesce during speaking engagements at Enactus World Cup Canada, Pine Ridge,
                Stylecon Newport Beach and Dixie University.

                Her Feb. 2017 keynote address at Dixie University, a Utah liberal arts college, centered on her
                family’s legacy in building a sense of community in post-Apartheid South Africa. Having been
                inspired by her grandmother who was a guiding light to women who endured the struggles of the
                Apartheid era, Swati is using her platform to expand on that theme, with an emphasis on the
                changing roles of women and children in society, women’s empowerment, the importance of
                diversity, rights of the disabled, and other vital societal issues.

            <p>
                Swati is the daughter of Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini and Princess Zenani Mandela. She resides in
                Johannesburg, South Africa.
